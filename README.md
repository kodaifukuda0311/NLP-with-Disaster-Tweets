## NLP Disaster Tweets Kaggle Mini-Project
This is the assignment of CU Boulder's *Introduction to Deep Learning*, Week 4 : Recurrent Neural Network.

### About dataset
Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency. The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they are observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).

But, it is not always clear whether a person's words are actually announcing a disaster. In this competition, we are challenged to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one's are not. https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started
